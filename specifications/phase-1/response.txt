Hello Jaimie,

Thank you for the clarification and for sharing the Engineer Onboarding README and the Engineering Implementation Specification.

Yes, this type of work suits me well. I am fully comfortable operating within a **fixed, non-negotiable specification**, with no conceptual input, redesign, or interpretation expected. I understand that the objective is an **exact, deterministic, and reproducible implementation**, and I confirm that I can implement the engine strictly according to the provided documents.

### Alignment with the specifications

I confirm in particular that:

* The implementation will follow the specification documents as the sole source of truth.
* Time handling will rely on the **IANA historical timezone database**, including full historical DST rules, with all internal calculations performed at second precision and input seconds fixed to `00`.
* Swiss Ephemeris, node policies, mandala constants, gate sequence, object ordering, and metadata requirements will be implemented exactly as specified.
* The calculation layer will remain strictly separated from any content, interpretation, or UI concerns.
* Golden test cases and JSON fixtures will be treated as authoritative, with any mismatch considered a defect.

### High-level implementation approach

At a high level, my approach would be:

1. **Specification lock-in**

   * Translate each section of the specification into explicit invariants and test expectations.

2. **Time & astronomy foundation**

   * Implement timezone handling using the IANA historical timezone library.
   * Validate local time → UTC → Julian Day conversion independently before proceeding.

3. **Ephemeris and astrology layer**

   * Integrate Swiss Ephemeris.
   * Match planetary positions, houses, ASC, and MC against reference fixtures.

4. **Human Design module**

   * Implement the Design-time solver exactly as specified (Sun −88°, bracketing, bisection, stop criteria).
   * Enforce strict object ordering and node policies.

5. **Mandala mapping and Gene Keys**

   * Implement mandala mapping as a pure mathematical transform using fixed constants and a fixed gate sequence.
   * Derive Gene Keys strictly from Human Design output within the defined V1 scope.

6. **Validation**

   * Golden test cases as the primary acceptance mechanism.
   * No tolerance for approximation or reinterpretation.

### Open technical points / assumptions

There are a few points that would need clarification or confirmation:

* **Target platform**: For a backend deployment, I provide by default code that can compile and run on macOS and Linux systems. If you need MS-Windows code it's also possible.
* **Programming language**: the specification does not mandate a language. I can implement this in whichever language you prefer. By default, I would propose **C**, as it offers straightforward and robust interfacing with Swiss Ephemeris and timezone libraries, and facilitates deterministic, low-level control. That said, I am flexible and can adapt to your preferred stack.
* **External interface**: several options are possible, depending on integration needs:

  * A simple **stdin/stdout interface using JSON** for inputs and outputs, suitable for batch processing and easy integration.
  * Alternatively, a minimal **HTTP service** exposing a calculation endpoint, suitable for web-based front-ends or service-oriented architectures.
  
I can adapt the interface design to your preferred integration model.

### Rough complexity and timeline

Assuming (1) Swiss Ephemeris is available and buildable in the target environment, (2) we have the fixed gate sequence and the expected JSON fixtures / golden outputs early, and (3) no additional scope beyond what is in the documents, my estimate is:

Estimated timeline:
Week 1 (core foundations)
    Implement input contract parsing and normalization (incl. seconds fixed to 00)
    Implement timezone handling using the IANA historical timezone database (local time → UTC)
    Implement UTC → Julian Day (UT)
    Integrate Swiss Ephemeris and compute all required bodies (incl. Mean + True node, derived Earth)
    Establish deterministic numeric formatting and rounding policy (applied only at the end, per spec)
Week 2 (domain modules)
    Astrology module: Placidus houses, ASC/MC, house cusps, Mean Node output formatting
    Human Design:
    Personality snapshot at birth
    Design-time solver (Sun −88°; bracket −84 to −90 days; bisection; stop criteria)
    Design snapshot calculation
    Mandala mapping implementation with fixed constants and fixed gate sequence
    Gene Keys derivation (V1 Activation Sequence only)
Week 3 (interfaces + tests + validation hardening)
    External interface implementation (either JSON stdin/stdout or minimal HTTP server, depending on your preference)
    Test harness and fixture runner (golden test cases, strict mismatch failure)
    Full validation pass against all fixtures (Astrology, HD Personality, HD Design, Gene Keys)
    Edge-case coverage focused on timezone boundaries, DST transitions, and historical offsets
Total estimate
    Core implementation: ~10 working days (2 weeks)
    Interfaces + tests + fixture validation: ~5 working days (1 week)
    Total: ~15 working days (~3 weeks)

This estimate assumes no scope changes and strict adherence to the current specification.

I am willing to review the materials in detail and provide an initial substantive response, and I am comfortable proceeding to a Proof of Capability (just review my resume, most projects required precision and determinism), and technical validation if there is a mutual fit.

Please let me know the next steps.

Kind regards,
Pascal Bourguignon
