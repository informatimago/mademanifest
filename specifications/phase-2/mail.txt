Hi Pascal,

Thank you for your willingness to proceed with the Proof of Capability.


As discussed, this email contains the materials and instructions for the Proof of Capability for the MadeManifest Deterministic Calculation Engine.


This Proof of Capability is intended to validate exact execution against a fixed specification. It is not a design exercise, not a discovery phase, and not an optimization task.


Attached you will find:

The Proof of Capability V1 document

The Engineering Implementation Specification (english version)

The Engineer Onboarding README (english version)

The Golden Test Case JSON and supporting canonical data


Objective

The objective is binary:
Given the exact input and materials provided, your implementation must produce the exact expected output, byte for byte.


Evaluation is pass or fail. Partial matches are not accepted.


Key constraints (non negotiable)

The provided documents are the sole sources of truth

Language, runtime, environment, dependencies, and interface are fixed as specified

No interpretation, optimization, or architectural decisions are allowed

Golden Test Case output must match exactly, including ordering, precision, and serialization

Any deviation is considered a defect


If you encounter anything you believe to be incorrect or suboptimal, you may document it as an observation, but the implementation must still follow the specification exactly.


Please note:

No clarification questions will be answered

The specification must be executed as written

Uncertainty must be resolved by exact execution, not interpretation


Deliverables

You may deliver either:

A working implementation that executes the Golden Test Case successfully, or

A test first implementation where the Golden Test Case passes exactly


Next step

Only if the Proof of Capability is completed successfully will we proceed to discuss the full engine scope, planning, and collaboration.


Please confirm once you have received the materials and indicate when you expect to submit your Proof of Capability.


Warm regards,
