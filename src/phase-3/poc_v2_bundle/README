How to run:
====================

- Source code written in Go:


    git clone https://github.com/informatimago/mademanifest.git

    # or:

    tar zxf mademanifest-phase-3-poc-2.tar.bz2

  The sources are in mademanifest/src/phase-3/poc_v2_bundle/mademanifest-engine/


- One command that produces an output JSON file from the Golden Test input

    make -C mademanifest/src/phase-3/poc_v2_bundle/ clean compile run

  The generated file is:
     mademanifest/src/phase-3/poc_v2_bundle/mademanifest-engine/out.json

  It's also printed out on the terminal.


- One command that diffs the produced output against the Golden Test
  expected output with no differences

    make -C mademanifest/src/phase-3/poc_v2_bundle/ clean compile diff ; echo $?

  While executing the program issues this one log message:
    2026/02/23 21:47:24 julian birth time = 2447991.169444
  And the status of the diff expected is:
    0
  (no difference).




Validation:
====================

- Bit exact numeric values                 ✓
- Exact JSON structure and ordering        ✓
- No tolerance or rounding freedom         ✓
- Deterministic output on repeated runs    ✓


Documentation & Requirement Tracking:
====================

The user manual of the proof-of-concept-v2 command:

    doc/user-manual.md
    doc/user-manual.pdf


Tracking of requirements is documented in:

    doc/requirement-tracking.org

(sorry for the wide tables).
In particular see note (2).


Docker:
====================

There are also targets to make and run with the docker image:

Create the docker image:

    make -C mademanifest/src/phase-3/poc_v2_bundle/  docker-image

Build the program in the docker image:

    make -C mademanifest/src/phase-3/poc_v2_bundle/  docker-compile

Run (diff) the program in the docker image:

    make -C mademanifest/src/phase-3/poc_v2_bundle/  docker-run
    


It's possible to get a new version from github without rebuilding the
whole docker image with

    make -C mademanifest/src/phase-3/poc_v2_bundle/  docker-update
